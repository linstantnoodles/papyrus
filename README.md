# Papyrus

This is a rails app I built to manage content on my personal website. Feel free to fork for your own use.

Shoutout to the contributors of [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) and [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) for making pure ruby markdown parsing and code highlighting possible!

Todo:

* Admin
    * Update preview to use branding render. This should remove the need to keep the admin post style up to date with the brand side.
    * Stylize links / buttons
* Brand
    * Add ability to add new top level sections. i.e: personal / misc, programming puzzle guides, lifestyle
    * Prototype a new navigation

Next: 
    * Add UI for adding posts children
    * Show post series separately

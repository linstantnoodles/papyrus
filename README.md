# Papyrus

This is a rails app I built to manage content on my personal website. Feel free to fork for your own use.

Shoutout to the contributors of [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) and [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) for making pure ruby markdown parsing and code highlighting possible!
